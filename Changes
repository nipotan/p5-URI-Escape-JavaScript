Revision history for Perl extension URI::Escape::JavaScript

  0.04  Fri Mar  5 11:13:41 2010
        - fixed in unescape(), was failed unescaping if the argument string
          was included some escaped patterns that are able to be seen a long
          (over 4 characters) hexdecimal string.
          currently, it substitutes only 4 characters behind "%u" to
          an unescaped character.
          (reported by Marinus).
